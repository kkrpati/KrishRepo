Java Developer-Back/Middle Office

Working as Java developer in Global Liquidity Platform (GLP) team. GLP has number of applications which are using the non-permitted technologies. My work is to migrate these applications to use permitted technologies (Horizon migration and AppHost migration)  and leverage best practices and design principles. I also worked on providing the enhancements to the existing functionality of GLP.

-	Migrated number of applications using Perforce version control, TeamCity, FishEye, Nexus Maven repo into Horizon platform (Utilizing Bitbucket, Artifactory, CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins & Ansible and SonarQube).
-	Converted some of the monolithic applications into micro-service based applications and developed new applications following the 12-factor principles using Spring Boot and related technologies with the intention to make the applications cloud-ready.
-	Refactored code using the latest dependencies and the configurations. Rewritten the auto-mated tests (Unit, DBITs, APITs, BDD tests) to run in isolation in the CI/CD pipeline.
-	Create CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Ansible playbook scripts.
-	Coded new SQL and PL-SQL scripts and rewritten existing scripts to run on Oracle 12C (DBaS). Working with DBAs resolve a few support tickets with Oracle after DB migrated from 11g to 12c.
-	Created new Jenkin deployment jobs after migration to deploy into the existing Linux servers.
-	Worked to setting up new infrastructure (AppHost VMs) and  configured the applications deployed in the VMs to connect to external end-points like  MQHub, ConnetDirect, DB, SMTP and FTP.
-	Working in Agile sprints and pairing with developers and testers to develop and test the user-stories in each sprint.
-	Monitored and improved the performance using the tools like jConsole, VisualVM and  DynaTrace
-	Providing technical help and mentoring to other team members.
-	Contributed towards developing the product backlog and actively involved in user-story grooming sessions.
-	Created guidelines for new developers for local working environment setup and updated the release guidelines for Application Support teams.
